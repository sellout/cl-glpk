;;; This high-level interface provides a macro that can be used as follows
;;;
;;;     (make-linear-program
;;;      :maximize (+ (* (- 12 2) x1) (* 6 x2) (* 4 x3))
;;;      :subject-to ((<= (+ x1 x2 x3) 100)
;;;                   (<= (+ (* (+ 2 2) x2) (* 10 x1) (* 5 x3)) (+ 200 400))
;;;                   (<= (+ (* 2 x1) (* 2 x2) (* 6 x3)) 300))
;;;      :bounds ((>= x3 10)))
;;;
;;; Features:
;;; – coefficients & bounds can be arbitrary lisp forms
;;; - terms in constraints don't have to be in same order as in the objective
;;;   function
;;; - (+ (* 4 x)) can be abbreviated as (* 4 x)
;;; - (* 1 x) can be abbreviated as x
;;; - not all variables need to occur in every constraint
;;; - variables can be left out of bounds list, indicating free variables
;;; - instead of :LOWER and :UPPER, use (<= lb (+ (* 4 x) ...) ub) [if there is
;;;   only one bound, you must have the variable before the bound. EG,
;;;   (>= x lb), not (<= lb x)?]
;;;
;;; TODO:
;;; - integrate bounds with constraints (either discover that it's just as fast
;;;   to combine them, or add code to separate out bounds before expansion)
